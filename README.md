# Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems

## Overview

This repository serves as a research notebook for exploratory work on
**brain-inspired cognitive systems**, with a focus on perception, memory,
learning, replay, and creativity.

The content reflects ongoing investigation rather than finalized claims.
Notes combine biological motivation, computational framing, and potential
engineering abstractions, particularly in relation to hippocampus–neocortex
interaction and the Thousand Brains / Monty framework.

## Scope and Intent

The goal of this repository is to:

- Clarify conceptual models of cognition inspired by neuroscience
- Identify gaps between biological mechanisms and current computational systems
- Explore minimal abstractions that could bridge those gaps in engineered systems
- Document evolving ideas in a transparent, versioned way

This is **not** a finished theory, library, or product. Ideas are expected to
change, be revised, or be discarded as understanding improves.

## Structure

- `notes/`  
  Research notes and conceptual explorations. Each note focuses on a specific
  question or theme (e.g. episodic memory, replay, cortical dynamics).

Future folders may include:
- `experiments/` — small computational experiments or prototypes
- `figures/` — diagrams and visualizations
- `drafts/` — early paper or proposal drafts

---

## Key Notes

- `notes/hippocampus-cortex-indexing.md`  
  A discussion of fast vs slow learning, hippocampal indexing, and a possible
  abstraction for episodic reinstatement in Monty.

(More notes will be added over time.)

## Methodological Position

This work is intentionally **interdisciplinary**:

- Neuroscience provides inspiration and constraints
- Computational models provide precision and testability
- Engineering considerations guide what is practical to implement

Biological realism is treated as a guide rather than a strict requirement;
the focus is on capturing **computational roles**, not necessarily exact
mechanisms.

## Status

Early-stage, exploratory.

Feedback, criticism, and alternative viewpoints are welcome.
