# Hippocampal Replay and Reinstantiation of Past Episodes

## Scope and Focus

In this document, I focus specifically on **hippocampal replay in its role of reinstantiating past episodes**.  
Other roles commonly attributed to hippocampal replay—such as organizing experiences across time and simulating future episodes—are acknowledged but intentionally set aside here.

## Replay as Reprocessing of Past Experience

In essence, hippocampal replay can be viewed as the reinstantiation of values encoded during direct interaction with the environment, followed by their reprocessing relative to predictions made by relevant cortical models.

When observed values differ from predicted values, the system enters an interesting regime: not one in which a discrete conclusion is rejected, but one in which cortical models are gradually updated so that future predictions better reflect what was actually perceived.

An intuitive analogy is post-match analysis in sports. After a loss, a team does not retroactively change the match outcome; instead, it revisits what happened in order to refine tactics for future games. In a similar way, replay allows the brain to reprocess past episodes under conditions more favorable for learning than real-time interaction.

At this stage, it remains an open question whether this analogy—especially the implication of internal simulation during replay—fully aligns with current neuroscientific evidence and will require further validation.

## Attention, Prediction Errors, and Replay

Assuming attention is a mechanism by which the brain biases which cortical columns influence inference and action (in Monty terms, which learning modules are allowed to vote), replay can be understood not as an explicit re-evaluation of alternative hypotheses, but as a process that revisits past experiences under conditions where such attentional biases are reduced or absent.

During the original experience, many cortical columns may have formed partial or weak hypotheses that did not influence behavior due to attentional constraints and the need for immediate action. Hippocampal replay reactivates these experiences in an offline context, allowing learning to proceed without selective voting or behavioral pressure.

From this perspective, mismatches between prediction and perception do not necessarily reflect an incorrect conclusion, but rather **incomplete integration of available information**—an inevitable consequence of limited attention in a sensory-rich environment. Replay provides a mechanism for compensating for these limitations by enabling broader integration across cortical models, thereby refining future predictions without explicitly identifying or correcting “wrong” attention.

## Open Questions

- To what extent does hippocampal replay involve simulation beyond reinstantiation of past episodes?
- How are attentional biases modulated or relaxed during replay at a mechanistic level?
- Which aspects of this interpretation are directly supported by experimental evidence, and which remain speculative?

These questions will be addressed in subsequent sections.
